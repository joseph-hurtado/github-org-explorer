# GitHub Org Explorer

This is the deprecated basic auth version

This package is my attempt solve a couple of my personal pain points
in using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) and GitHub Classroom Assistant.

After you log in, select an organzation. 

You can then use the regex filter to select a subset of the repos in the organzation after which you can either:

 1. Export - this will export the selected repos.
 2. Delete - delete the selected repos.

# Notes

When deleting, it takes a bit of time for the API to update. Right
now, this doesn't happen automatically. You should periodically hit
the refresh button to see the updates.

Likewise, it takes a bit of time to load a large organization - please be patient.




## How to Run
```
npm install electron-prebuilt -g
npm install shadow-cljs -g
npm install

npm run dev
electron .
```

## Release
```
npm run build
electron-packager . GitHub-Org-Browser --platform=all --arch=x64
```

The above will build for alla vailable platforms. To just build one, specify platform:

 - darwin
 - linux
 - mas
 - win32
 
 
Arch can be ia32, x63, armv7l, arm64, or mips64el

The directories created by electorn-packager contain the full release - you can run or install from there.

You can always run the application from this directory after building via *electron .*
